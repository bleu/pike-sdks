This repository is a monorepo containing packages designed to facilitate integrations with the Pike lending protocol. It provides essential tools, utilities, and example applications for developers looking to build on top of or interact with Pike Markets.

## Overview

The Pike Integration Monorepo is structured to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for interacting with Pike lending protocol:

- **Core Utilities**: Base calculation engines and contract interfaces
- **API Clients**: Type-safe clients for interacting with Pike's indexer
- **EVM integrators**: Integration with EVM packages to connect with Pike contracts

## Applications

### Pike Indexer

Pike Markets Indexer is a robust multi-chain data indexing solution built with [Ponder](https://ponder.sh/). It serves as the backbone for tracking and querying Pike Markets-related on-chain information across multiple blockchains.

**Key Features:**

- Multi-chain data indexing and synchronization
- GraphQL API for flexible data querying
- Supplementary REST endpoints for user metrics
- Real-time event processing and indexing
- Comprehensive historical data access

For detailed information about the indexer, please refer to the [app documentation](./packages/ponder-app/README.md).
